  desc: Make text on maps an accessible resource
  abstract: Machines Reading Maps (MRM) is a collaborative project between the Digital Library and Spatial Sciences Institute at the University of Southern California (US)and the Alan Turing Institute (UK). The project is funded by the United States’ National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the United Kingdom’s Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) under the first round of NEH/AHRC New Directions for Digital Scholarship. MRM seeks to normalize map text as a new kind of data that can be used across the humanities and the heritage sector. To do so MRM will change the way that humanists and heritage professionals interact with digitised map images. Maps constitute a significant body of global cultural heritage, and they are being scanned at a rapid pace in the US and UK. However, most critical investigation of maps continues on a small scale, through close readings of a few maps. Individual maps communicate through visual grammars, supplemented by text. But text on maps, particularly in aggregate, is a nearly untapped source about the construction of knowledge about place (with the notable exception of the GB1900 project, which crowdsourced transcriptions of all labels on the ca.1900 6-inch Ordnance Survey maps of Britain). While we speak colloquially about reading maps, MRM concretely addresses how to make text on maps an accessible resource. We will make maps searchable and linked to other geospatial data and collections, creating the possibility for humanities research that uses map text as a primary source. Spatial searching will no longer be limited by metadata fields like place of publication, but instead allows queries based on the labeled, spatial content of visual materials.

  desc: Mining Large Multi-Scale Trajectory Data for Moving Behavior Detection 
  abstract: Mining moving behaviors from trajectories is an important task but often relies on tedious manual work that cannot scale to process large amounts of trajectory data. Here, the moving behavior of a trajectory refers to the activity type describing the purpose of the movement (in space and time) regardless of the spatial and temporal scale of the trajectory (hence the term “multi-scale”). We develop several new capabilities for robust mining moving behaviors from large multi-scale trajectory data.

  abstract: This project's overall goal is to develop a data and AI-driven approach to analyze anonymized data logs (~1 billion records) from the network devices (e.g., WAN routers and LAN switches) that NTT Global Networks (NTT GN) collects, monitors, and manages. The project results include a machine learning approach and its software implementation to detect issues that ultimately give rise to network outages or trouble tickets requiring NTT GN network engineers to investigate and resolve. Towards this end, we have developed an end-to-end approach to 1) generate baseline representations in the form of real-number feature vectors for capturing network activities and 2) predict events (issues) given recent network activities (e.g., in the last 300 minutes).

  desc: Generating rich metadata from historical map content
  abstract: Historical maps typically exist as scanned images without searchable metadata. Existing approaches making historical maps searchable rely on tedious manual work (including crowd-sourcing) to generate the metadata (e.g., geolocations and keywords). mapKurator addresses the real-world problem of finding and indexing historical map images by automatically extract their text content and generates a set of metadata linked to large external geospatial knowledge bases. The linked metadata in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) format support complex queries for finding and indexing historical maps, such as retrieving all historical maps covering mountain peaks higher than 1,000 meters in California.

  desc: Predicting and forecasting fine-scale air quality
  abstract: "Air quality models are important for studying the impact of air pollutants on health conditions. Existing work typically relies on area-specific, expert-selected attributes of pollution emissions (e.g., transportation) and dispersion (e.g., meteorology) for building the model for each combination of study areas, pollutant types, and spatiotemporal scales. In this project, we build a data mining approach, JonSnow, which utilizes publicly available OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to automatically generate an air quality model for the prediction and forecasting concentrations for any type of pollutants at various temporal scales. Our approach utilizes the PRISMS-DSCIC infrastructure developed at the USC Information Sciences Institute as the data collection, manipulation, and analysis platform. The PRISMS-DSCIC (Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems - Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center) is an NIH-NIBIB (National Institutes of Health - National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering) funded initiative to address pediatric asthma as a chronic disease of childhood. PRISMS-DSCIC is responsible for collecting, storing, integrating, and analyzing real-time environmental, physiological, and behavioral data obtained from heterogeneous sensors and traditional data sources to help researchers predict and prevent asthma attacks efficiently. JonSnow automatically generates (domain-) expert-free models for accurate PM2.5 concentration predictions and forecasting, which can be used to improve air quality studues that traditionally rely on expert-selected input."

This framework is intended to exploit existing geographic data to build generic semantic models of geographic phenomena and use the models to extract geographic features from maps, evaluate (the semantic consistency), update the extracted data, and link the data across space and time.

  desc: Forecasting Large-scale and Long-term Performance Measurement of Public Transportation Systems
  abstract: Accurate forecasting of public transportation metrics is critical towards the high reliability and efficiency of the public transportation system. However, deploying a forecasting system to serve city-level public transportation with long-term forecasting is challenging. In this project, we develop the capability to process the entire Los Angeles Metropolitan Area (LAMA) for long-term forecasting of various public transportation system performance metrics. First, we explore both spatial statistical methods and machine learning methods to estimate traffic flows for the road segments that do not have traffic sensors. Second, we develop methods to enable traffic forecasting with a deep learning model designed for small networks for the entire LAMA road network. We also study various training strategies (e.g., teacher forcing) to enable accurate long-term forecasting of traffic flows and bus arrival times. Lastly, we develop an end-to-end deep learning approach that combines the estimation and forecasting of traffic flow with data imputation methods for estimating bus arrival time for each stop in individual bus routes in LAMA. Using the real-world traffic data in the University of Southern California Archived Transportation Data Management System (ADMS), we show that the proposed approach and system can predict bus arrival times with a city-level spatial coverage and a route-level temporal forecasting horizon. We also demonstrate the overall result of the bus arrival time estimation in a web dashboard. This dashboard enables users at all levels of technical skills to benefit from the developed machine learning approach and access valuable information for trip planning, vehicle management, and policymaking.

  abstract: Collaborating with the University of Southern California’s Integrated Media Systems Center (USC, IMSC), Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA Metro), and USC METRANS, we develop a big transportation data warehouse – the Archived Traffic Data Management System (ADMS). ADMS fuses and analyzes a very large-scale and high-resolution (both spatial and temporal) traffic sensor data from different transportation authorities in Southern California, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT), California Highway Patrol (CHP), Long Beach Transit (LBT). This dataset includes both inventory and real-time data with update rate as high as every 30 seconds for freeway and arterial traffic sensors (14,500 loop-detectors) covering 4,300 miles, 2,000 bus, and train automatic vehicle location (AVL), incidents such as accidents, traffic hazards and road closures reported (approximately 400 per day) by LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) and CHP, and ramp meters. USC IMSC has been continuously collecting and archiving the datasets mentioned above since 2011. ADMS is the largest traffic sensor data warehouse built so far in Southern California.
