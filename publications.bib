    abstract = {Text on historical maps contains valuable information providing georeferenced historical, political, and cultural contexts. However, text extraction from historical maps has been challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SYNTHMAP+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SYNTHMAP+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SYNTHMAP+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in incorporating physical knowledge into deep neural networks can estimate previously unknown governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven way. They have shown promising results in spatiotemporal predictive learning. However, these methods typically assume universal governing PDEs across space, which is impractical for modeling complex spatiotemporal phenomena with high spatial variability (e.g., climate). Also, they cannot effectively model the evolution of potential errors in estimating the physical dynamics over time. This paper introduces a physics-guided neural network, SVPNet, which learns effective physical representations by estimating the error evolution in physics states for correction and modeling spatially varying physical dynamics to predict the next state. Experiments carried out in four scenarios, including benchmarks and real-world datasets, show that SVPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatiotemporal prediction tasks for natural processes and significantly improves prediction when training data are limited. Ablation studies also highlight that SVPNet is powerful in capturing physical dynamics in complex physical systems.},

abstract = {Abstract Traffic prediction for scenic spots is an important topic in modeling an urban traffic system. Existing traffic prediction approaches typically use raw traffic data and road networks without considering the physical environment and human–environment interaction. This article presents a novel traffic prediction model that considers: (1) the topological structure of the city road network; (2) the popularity and accessibility of each scenic spot in the city; and (3) the traffic volumes of nearby scenic spots. The proposed model first learns a series of traffic dependency graphs by the Multi-graph Convolutional Network using multiple data sources describing historical traffic volumes, scenic spots popularity, land function, location, and accessibility. The graph nodes represent the scenic spots, and the links between them represent their traffic dependency, considering all traffic and geographic features. Then the proposed model uses the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture the temporal dependency between multiple fused graphs for traffic volume prediction. The experiments show that the proposed model (M-GCNGRU) can effectively exploit and integrate geographic data with historical traffic data for traffic volume prediction, outperforming several classical and state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Many approaches to time series classification rely on machine learning methods. However, there is growing interest in going beyond black box prediction models to understand discriminatory features of the time series and their associations with outcomes. One promising method is time-series shapelets (TSS), which identifies maximally discriminative subsequences of time series. For example, in environmental health applications TSS could be used to identify short-term patterns in exposure time series (shapelets) associated with adverse health outcomes. Identification of candidate shapelets in TSS is computationally intensive. The original TSS algorithm used exhaustive search. Subsequent algorithms introduced efficiencies by trimming/aggregating the set of candidates or training candidates from initialized values, but these approaches have limitations. In this paper, we introduce Wavelet-TSS (W-TSS) a novel intelligent method for identifying candidate shapelets in TSS using wavelet transformation discovery. We tested W-TSS on two datasets: (1) a synthetic example used in previous TSS studies and (2) a panel study relating exposures from residential air pollution sensors to symptoms in participants with asthma. Compared to previous TSS algorithms, W-TSS was more computationally efficient, more accurate, and was able to discover more discriminative shapelets. W-TSS does not require pre-specification of shapelet length.},
